added smile data images:
train - training data
test - test progress while running
validate - check how final result is

changed mnist_loader.py to load smile images

changed network.py to work with smile images. Final network has size of [31266, 120, 1]
using:
eta = 0.25
epochs = 300
mini_batch_size = 10

added full_run.py that creates the network, sends it to train, and validates it. This is to save time in the future.

Final result - test data 100% validation data 91%
